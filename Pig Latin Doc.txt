You could do this without a loop but it would be a little painful imo.
Could also do this without a list but I thought it was easier that way and it plays nice with my loops.

Refactor:
Try and add a way to check for a valid string; Recommend using some form of type comparison. IE: .isalpha or something

Challenge:
Do this without any kind of loop. Pretty sure you can, haven't tried myself but I have a feeling you're gonna need A LOT of if statements and len() is gonna be important. Even cooler if you can do it without using any helper methods.
